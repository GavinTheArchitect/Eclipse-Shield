# Eclipse Shield Code of Conduct

## Overview

All contributors are expected to:

- Be respectful and professional in all project communications
- Collaborate constructively and help others when possible
- Report bugs, vulnerabilities, or issues responsibly
- Avoid personal attacks, harassment, or disruptive behavior

## Reporting

If you encounter behavior that violates these guidelines, please report it using the project's issue tracker or the Security Report template for sensitive matters.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers will review and address reports as needed. Actions may include warnings, removal of content, or restricting participation.

## Summary

Let's work together to make Eclipse Shield a productive, respectful, and secure open source project.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement through
GitHub Issues or Discussions with the conduct label.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

### Security Violations

Security-related violations should be reported through:
- **General conduct issues**: GitHub Issues with conduct label
- **Security misuse**: Security Report template
- **Vulnerability exploitation**: Security Report template

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

### 5. Security Violations (Additional)

**Community Impact**: Misuse of security information, exploitation of
vulnerabilities, or malicious use of security knowledge gained through
participation in the project.

**Consequence**: Immediate permanent ban from the community and potential
reporting to relevant authorities if laws have been broken. All access to
project resources will be revoked.
