# Eclipse Shield Security Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in Eclipse Shield to protect against common web application vulnerabilities and attacks.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. WSGI Server Deployment
- **Gunicorn** WSGI server for production deployment
- Multiple worker processes with gevent for handling concurrent requests
- Process recycling to prevent memory leaks
- Graceful shutdowns and worker management

### 2. Reverse Proxy with Nginx
- Rate limiting at the web server level
- SSL/TLS termination
- Static file serving with caching
- Request filtering and blocking
- Security headers enforcement

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- API key authentication for sensitive endpoints
- CSRF protection with token validation
- Session management with secure cookies
- Rate limiting per IP address

### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization
- Comprehensive URL validation
- Domain format validation
- HTML/XSS payload sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- File upload restrictions
- Request size limits

### 5. Security Headers
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS)
- `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP)
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

### 6. Rate Limiting
- Global rate limits (100 requests/hour)
- Strict limits for API endpoints (10 requests/minute)
- IP-based tracking and blocking
- Automatic cleanup of tracking data

### 7. Firewall & Intrusion Prevention
- UFW firewall configuration
- Fail2ban for intrusion detection and prevention
- Automatic IP blocking for suspicious activity
- Log monitoring and alerting

### 8. Monitoring & Logging
- Structured logging with rotation
- Security event monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- Automated backup procedures

## Configuration Files

### Security Configuration (`security.py`)
Contains all security-related classes and utilities:
- `SecurityConfig`: Central security configuration
- `InputValidator`: Input validation utilities
- `SecurityMiddleware`: Request processing middleware

### Secure Application (`secure_app.py`)
Production-ready Flask application with:
- Security middleware integration
- Comprehensive error handling
- Thread-safe caching
- Request validation decorators

### WSGI Entry Point (`wsgi.py`)
Production WSGI interface with:
- Production logging configuration
- Log rotation
- Error handling

## Deployment Security

### 1. Production Deployment Script (`deploy.sh`)
Automated deployment with security hardening:
- System package updates
- Firewall configuration
- Fail2ban setup
- SSL/TLS preparation
- Service monitoring

### 2. Process Management
- Supervisor for process monitoring
- Automatic restart on failures
- Resource limiting
- User privilege separation

### 3. Network Security
- Firewall rules (UFW)
- Port restrictions
- SSL/TLS encryption
- Request filtering

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Tests (`security_test.py`)
Comprehensive test suite covering:
- Security header validation
- Rate limiting verification
- Input validation testing
- XSS protection testing
- File access protection
- CSRF protection
- Information disclosure prevention

### Running Security Tests
```bash
python3 security_test.py http://localhost:5000
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Use `.env` files for sensitive configuration
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use strong, unique passwords

### 2. Regular Updates
- Keep all dependencies updated
- Monitor security advisories
- Apply security patches promptly
- Regular security assessments

### 3. Monitoring
- Monitor application logs daily
- Set up alerting for security events
- Track failed authentication attempts
- Monitor resource usage

### 4. Backup & Recovery
- Automated daily backups
- Test backup restoration procedures
- Secure backup storage
- Document recovery procedures

## Common Vulnerabilities Addressed

### 1. OWASP Top 10
- **A01:2021 - Broken Access Control**: API key authentication, input validation
- **A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures**: Secure session management, HTTPS
- **A03:2021 - Injection**: Input sanitization, parameterized queries
- **A04:2021 - Insecure Design**: Security-first architecture
- **A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration**: Hardened default configurations
- **A06:2021 - Vulnerable Components**: Dependency management, updates
- **A07:2021 - Identity and Authentication Failures**: Secure authentication
- **A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures**: Input validation
- **A09:2021 - Security Logging Failures**: Comprehensive logging
- **A10:2021 - Server-Side Request Forgery**: URL validation, IP filtering

### 2. Additional Protections
- **DDoS Protection**: Rate limiting, connection limits
- **Bot Protection**: User-Agent validation, behavior analysis
- **Data Leakage**: Error handling, information disclosure prevention
- **Session Security**: Secure cookies, session timeout

## Incident Response

### 1. Detection
